## Project Description:

What was our shape leading up to and during that play?

The UC San Diego Soccer coaches want a better tool to assess and communicate player spacing (shape) during key moments of the competition. While game film is available, they are not pleased with the sideline angle for reference to spacing across the field or players not in screen. While opponent location is not available, the UCSD players use a wearable GPS tracking device. The coaches want an app that allows them to go to key moments of the game by time stamp annotation, and visualize the location / distribution of the players during that play.

-   Play by Play annotation from StatCrew

## Key Learning Objectives

1.  Create visualizations to show multiple players location simultaneously
2.  Application that allows the user to navigate through identified time points for analyses
3.  Optimized UI/UX for coach interaction and storytelling.

## Secondary Objectives

1. Analyze player distribution impact on game play / success
2. Predict how specific types of interactions during game play leads to key events (i.e. middle 3rd turnover with pressing midfield)
